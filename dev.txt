LVS vehicle now spawns with 3 new functions:

lvs_vehicle:ReforgerCleanDecals()
-- Clears decals from all parts and wheels, not just the main body.

lvs_vehicle:StartInnerFire(repeatCount: number)
-- Starts inner fire event.
-- Calls hook: Reforger.InnerFireStarted(lvs_entity: Entity, repeatCount: number)

lvs_vehicle:StopInnerFire()
-- Stops inner fire event.
-- Calls hook: Reforger.InnerFireStopped(lvs_entity: Entity)


Pre-hooks:

Reforger.CanStartInnerFire(lvs_entity: Entity, repeatCount: number)
-- Called before starting inner fire.
-- Return false to prevent it.

Reforger.CanStopInnerFire(lvs_entity: Entity)
-- Called before stopping inner fire.
-- Return false to prevent it.


!!!! NOTE: repeatCount is how many times the timer will update and ignite the transport !!!!
